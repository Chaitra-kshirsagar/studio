## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Bhumi's Orange (#F26419) embodying energy, enthusiasm, and a call to action. This color reflects Bhumi's dynamic approach and inspires volunteers to get involved.
- Secondary color: Bhumi's Green (#2A9D8F) to represent growth, sustainability, and harmony. This color complements the orange and reflects Bhumi's environmental initiatives.
- Accent color: A vibrant Yellow (#F4A261) for highlighting key interactive elements and calls to action. Yellow adds a touch of optimism and encourages engagement.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F2F2F2), a neutral tone to ensure content readability and a clean, uncluttered interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Roboto', a sans-serif for its modern, readable design suitable for both headers and body text.
- Use simple, clean icons from a set like Material Icons to visually represent event types, locations, and tools, reinforcing a streamlined, intuitive experience.
- Implement a card-based layout for event listings and volunteer profiles, making effective use of white space to create an uncluttered, visually appealing design.
- Subtle transitions and animations when loading content or interacting with elements. Animations should be unobtrusive, purely functional, and quick.
